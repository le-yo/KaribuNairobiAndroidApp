THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM
Holy Baptism is the basis of the whole Christian life, the gateway to life in the Spirit (vitae spiritualis ianua), 
and the door which gives access to the other sacraments.

THE SACRAMENT OF CONFIRMATION
The reception of the sacrament of Confirmation is necessary for the completion of baptismal grace. For "by the sacrament of Confirmation,
[the baptized] are more perfectly bound to the Church and are enriched with a special strength of the Holy Spirit. Hence they are, 
as true witnesses of Christ, more strictly obliged to spread and defend the faith by word and deed.

THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST
The holy Eucharist completes Christian initiation. Those who have been raised to the dignity of the royal priesthood by Baptism and configured more 
deeply to Christ by Confirmation participate with the whole community in the Lord's own sacrifice by means of the Eucharist.
