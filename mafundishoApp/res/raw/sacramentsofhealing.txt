THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE AND RECONCILIATION
Those who approach the sacrament of Penance obtain pardon from God's mercy for the offense committed against him, and are, at the same time, 
reconciled with the Church which they have wounded by their sins and which by charity, by example, and by prayer labors for their conversion.

THE ANOINTING OF THE SICK
By the sacred anointing of the sick and the prayer of the priests the whole Church commends those who are ill to the suffering and glorified Lord,
 that he may raise them up and save them. and indeed she exhorts them to contribute to the good of the People of God by freely uniting themselves
 to the Passion and death of Christ.
