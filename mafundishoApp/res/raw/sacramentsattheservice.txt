THE SACRAMENT OF HOLY ORDERS
Holy Orders is the sacrament through which the mission entrusted by Christ to his apostles continues to be exercised in the Church until the end of time:
thus it is the sacrament of apostolic ministry. It includes three degrees: episcopate, presbyterate, and diaconate.

THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY
The matrimonial covenant, by which a man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life,
is by its nature ordered toward the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of offspring; this covenant between baptized persons 
has been raised by Christ the Lord to the dignity of a sacrament.
