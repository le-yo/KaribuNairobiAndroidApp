The plan of this catechism is inspired by the great tradition of catechisms which build catechesis on four pillars: the baptismal profession of faith (the Creed), the sacraments of faith, the life of faith (the Commandments), and the prayer of the believer (the Lord's Prayer). These four sections have been covered in this app in full or as Questions and Answers(QA) session. You can also be able to locate Catholic Churches around Nairobi where you can attend Catechism classes.
